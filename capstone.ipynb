    "\n",
    "1. Incorrect values - MIMIC-II was not collected for research and is a combination of two different electronic medical record systems (CareVue and Metavision). This increase the likelihood of inaccuracies in data entry and extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Missing data/sparseness: there is variation in the information recorded between patients due to different uses of the EMR (e.g. use of a separate system for recording lab results, or medications) across time, and the data being collected for clinical relevance rather than research.\n",
    "\n",
    "All patients have a unique identifying ID (subject_id), a hospital stay ID (hadm_id) and an ICU stay ID (icustay_id). These IDs can be used to identify readmissions to hospital and ICU."
